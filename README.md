# GTA-ADVANCE-HULK-MOD
The most complete GTA Advance mod!

In 2018 i decided to start a project to modify or to simply try to modify GTA Advance by hexadecimal codes.

After a successfully effort to change the color of Mike, i felt more confident of what i should make with the versions of the game.
From that, i invited my friend Brayam to help me putting things in order and here we are...
